## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

1. **Run searches** using the guide in ICDL_2025_SEARCH_GUIDE.md
2. **For each paper found**, fill in one section below
3. **Copy-paste abstracts** verbatim so you don't misinterpret later
4. **Rate threat level** honestly (don't downplay competitors)
5. **Keep running tally** at bottom of "papers found so far"

## GAPS & FOLLOW-UP SEARCHES NEEDED

If you find references in papers to other related work not in ICDL 2025, list them here for follow-up:

| Cited Paper | Year | Reason Relevant | Status |
|------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| [Title] | [Year] | Relevant to [topic] | [Found/Not Found] |

---

## THREAT LEVEL REFERENCE

- **5/5**: Directly competes with our core claims. Same mechanism, same domain. Likely rejection if not differentiated.
- **4/5**: High overlap in mechanism or domain. Could threaten novelty if combined with other papers. Must differentiate strongly.
- **3/5**: Significant overlap in one component but overall approach differs. Must cite and acknowledge their approach vs ours.
- **2/5**: Moderate overlap or adjacent topic. Should cite for thoroughness. Our approach is clearly different.
- **1/5**: Minimal overlap or historical reference. Can cite briefly or in future work. Low threat.
