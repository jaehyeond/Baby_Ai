================================================================================
SECTION 5: REFERENCE MINING (Follow the citations)
================================================================================

Once you find your first 5-10 papers:

[ ] For each paper found:
    [ ] Read the "Related Work" section
    [ ] Note any papers cited that overlap with your interests
    [ ] Record papers that are from ICDL 2024-2025 (may indicate ICDL 2025 relevance)
    [ ] Search for papers by co-authors

[ ] Look for "See Also" / "Related Work" sections
[ ] Check if papers cite each other (creates networks of related work)

================================================================================
SECTION 6: VERIFICATION & QUALITY CHECK
================================================================================

For EACH paper you find, verify:

[ ] Title is EXACT (not paraphrased)
[ ] Authors are correct and in correct order
[ ] DOI/link works and links to correct paper
[ ] Abstract matches the title (no accidental duplicates)
[ ] Conference year is confirmed as 2025
[ ] Content actually relates to emotion/memory/learning (not just keywords)

RED FLAGS (discard if found):
[ ] Title or authors don't match abstract content
[ ] Same paper listed twice under different names
[ ] Paper is from 2024 conference (not 2025)
[ ] Paper is from non-ICDL conference (unless you're doing broader search)
[ ] Abstract is auto-generated nonsense (happens with OCR errors)

================================================================================
SECTION 7: DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

As you find papers, record each in: ICDL_2025_PAPER_TRACKER.md

For each paper record:
[ ] Title (exact)
[ ] Authors (all, in order)
[ ] Abstract (copy-paste verbatim)
[ ] DOI/IEEE Xplore link
[ ] Conference session/track (if available)
[ ] Key contribution (your summary)
[ ] Technical mechanism (your summary)
[ ] Overlap areas with BabyBrain (check boxes)
[ ] Their strengths vs BabyBrain
[ ] BabyBrain's strengths vs theirs
[ ] Threat level (1-5/5)
[ ] Must cite? (YES/SHOULD/OPTIONAL)
[ ] Draft citation sentence

================================================================================
SECTION 8: ANALYSIS & SYNTHESIS
================================================================================

After collecting all papers:

[ ] Create summary table: All papers found with threat levels
[ ] Count papers by threat level:
    - 5/5 = _____ papers (likely reject if not differentiated)
    - 4/5 = _____ papers (major threats, must differentiate)
    - 3/5 = _____ papers (significant overlap, must cite)
    - 2/5 = _____ papers (moderate overlap, should cite)
    - 1/5 = _____ papers (minimal overlap, optional cite)

[ ] Identify "clusters" of related papers
[ ] Note any research communities/groups that appear multiple times
[ ] Identify gaps (areas you thought might be covered but aren't)
[ ] Identify surprising papers (topics you didn't expect)

[ ] Draft "Related Work" sections:
    - Group papers by topic (Intrinsic Motivation, Memory, Emotion, etc.)
    - Write 2-3 sentence summary of each topic area
    - Explain how BabyBrain differs from/builds on this work

================================================================================

SECTION 11: CONTINGENCY PLANS
================================================================================

IF you cannot find ICDL 2025 proceedings:
  [ ] Check if papers were published to arXiv instead
  [ ] Check researchgate.net for papers by key authors
  [ ] Email authors directly asking if they presented at ICDL 2025
  [ ] Check ICDL-EpiRob combined proceedings (they merged conferences)
  [ ] Broaden search to ICDL 2024 and adjacent 2025 conferences (AAMAS, CoRL)

IF you find conflicting information (same paper with different titles):
  [ ] Check DOI to verify it's the same paper
  [ ] Use DOI as source of truth
  [ ] Note which source had incorrect info

IF you find a paper that PERFECTLY matches BabyBrain's novelty claims:
  [ ] STOP and inform team immediately
  [ ] Download full paper and read carefully
  [ ] Assess whether claims are identical or different
  [ ] Decide if submission is still viable
  [ ] Adjust novelty claims if needed

================================================================================
